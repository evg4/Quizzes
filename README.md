## Project Title
Quizzes
## Description
I completed this project on 27.07.23 to practise importing and exporting modules for use in the Node runtime environment. I have one file named quiz-questions.js which contains an array of questions and a corresponding array of answers. I then have 3 quizzes which all use the same questions and answers but which work in different ways:
* quiz1.js - in this version, as soon as the user gets a question wrong, they lose and the quiz is over. I use a while loop to implement it.
* quiz2.js - in this version, users have 3 lives. If they get an answer wrong, they lose a life. The quiz stops when all questions have been attempted or when lives run out, whichever is soonest. This also uses a while loop.
* quiz3.js - in this version, users can attempt all questions. They do not know until the end whether their answers were correct or not. At the end, their final score is revealed, along with any answers they got wrong.
 ## Features
This is built in JavaScript. It is to be used in node, not the browser.
## How to use
The quizzes can be played in node. Open any of the quiz files, and once the programme is run, the game will begin automatically.
## Technologies
